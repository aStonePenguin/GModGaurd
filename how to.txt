-- Install dotnet:
https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#linuxdebian

-- Edit and move Servers.json to your install dir

-- Edit the user and directories in gmodgaurd.service
-- Move gmodgaurd.service to /etc/systemd/system (if your on a system that doesnt have systemctl you'll be on your own as far as auto restaring goes)

-- Enable & Start it:
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl disable gmodgaurd.service
systemctl restart gmodgaurd
systemctl stop gmodgaurd

-- Add iptables rules in FIREWALL RULES.txt (May also want to rate limit a2s_* to start I have no idea how much cpu this will use if someone decides to try hard):
